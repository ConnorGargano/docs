# Event Types

Event types allow you to create different events for different occasions when booking a time with you in your calendar. These can be named differently, have different time durations and the choice of platform can change.

## Delete an event type

1. Go to [Your Event Types](https://app.cal.com/event-types).
2. Click anywhere within the box of the event, just like you would if you were editing the event.
3. From this page, just to the right, a button saying 'delete' will appear. Click this and your event will be deleted!
